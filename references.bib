	abstract = {Quantum error correction {$[$}1, 2, 3, 4{$]$} provides a path to reach practical quantum computing by combining multiple physical qubits into a logical qubit, where the logical error rate is suppressed exponentially as more qubits are added. However, this exponential suppression only occurs if the physical error rate is below a critical threshold. Here, we present two below-threshold surface code memories on our newest generation of superconducting processors, Willow: a distance-7 code, and a distance-5 code integrated with a real-time decoder. The logical error rate of our larger quantum memory is suppressed by a factor of {\$}{\$}{$\backslash$}varLambda {$\backslash$}mathrm{\{}=2.14{\}}{$\backslash$}pm 0.02{\$}{\$}when increasing the code distance by two, culminating in a 101-qubit distance-7 code with 0.143{\%} $\pm$0.003{\%} error per cycle of error correction. This logical memory is also beyond break-even, exceeding its best physical qubit's lifetime by a factor of {\$}{\$}2.4{$\backslash$}pm 0.3{\$}{\$}. Our system maintains below-threshold performance when decoding in real time, achieving an average decoder latency of 63 μs at distance-5 up to a million cycles, with a cycle time of 1.1 μs. We also run repetition codes up to distance-29 and find that logical performance is limited by rare correlated error events occurring approximately once every hour, or {\$}{\$}3{\$}{\$}{\$}{\$}{$\backslash$}times {\$}{\$}{\$}{\$}{\{}10{\}}\^{}{\{}9{\}}{\$}{\$}cycles. Our results present device performance that, if scaled, could realize the operational requirements of large scale fault-tolerant quantum algorithms.},

	n2 = {Abstract Quantum computers can in principle solve certain problems exponentially more quickly than their classical counterparts. We have not yet reached the advent of useful quantum computation, but when we do, it will affect nearly all scientific disciplines. In this review, we examine how current quantum algorithms could revolutionize computational biology and bioinformatics. There are potential benefits across the entire field, from the ability to process vast amounts of information and run machine learning algorithms far more efficiently, to algorithms for quantum simulation that are poised to improve computational calculations in drug discovery, to quantum algorithms for optimization that may advance fields from protein structure prediction to network analysis. However, these exciting prospects are susceptible to ?hype,? and it is also important to recognize the caveats and challenges in this new technology. Our aim is to introduce the promise and limitations of emerging quantum computing technologies in the areas of computational molecular biology and bioinformatics.

@article{Hu:2023,
	abstract = {Thirty years after it was first proposed, quantum teleportation remains one of the most important protocols in quantum information and quantum technologies, enabling the nonlocal transmission of an unknown quantum state. Quantum teleportation can be used to overcome the distance limitation in directly transferring quantum states in quantum communication and the difficulty in realizing long-range interactions among qubits in quantum computation. Since 2015, experimental quantum teleportation has moved from simple to complex quantum states (multiple degrees of freedom, high-dimensional quantum states) and from proof-of-principle demonstrations to real-world applications. We overview these advances, in particular, the understanding of the nonclassical nature of quantum teleportation, the teleportation of complex quantum states, progress in experiments with photons, atoms and solid-state systems and applications to quantum communication and computation, and discuss the challenges and opportunities for future developments.},

@article{Takesue:2015,
	abstract = {Quantum teleportation is an essential quantum operation by which we can transfer an unknown quantum state to a remote location with the help of quantum entanglement and classical communication. Since the first experimental demonstrations using photonic qubits and continuous variables, the distance of photonic quantum teleportation over free-space channels has continued to increase and has reached {$>$}100\&{\#}x2009;\&{\#}x2009;km. On the other hand, quantum teleportation over optical fiber has been challenging, mainly because the multifold photon detection that inevitably accompanies quantum teleportation experiments has been very inefficient due to the relatively low detection efficiencies of typical telecom-band single-photon detectors. Here, we report on quantum teleportation over optical fiber using four high-detection-efficiency superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs). These SNSPDs make it possible to perform highly efficient multifold photon measurements, allowing us to confirm that the quantum states of input photons were successfully teleported over 100\&{\#}xA0;km of fiber with an average fidelity of 83.7\&{\#}xB1;2.0{\%}.},

abstract = {The hyperfine interaction of an electron with the nuclei is considered as the primary obstacle to coherent control of the electron spin in semiconductor quantum dots. We show, however, that the nuclei in singly charged quantum dots act constructively by focusing the electron spin precession about a magnetic field into well-defined modes synchronized with a laser pulse protocol. In a dot with a synchronized electron, the light-stimulated fluctuations of the hyperfine nuclear field acting on the electron are suppressed. The information about electron spin precession is imprinted in the nuclei and thereby can be stored for tens of minutes in darkness. The frequency focusing drives an electron spin ensemble into dephasing-free subspaces with the potential to realize single frequency precession of the entire ensemble.}}
