@book{Nielsen:2010,
	abstract = {One of the most cited books in physics of all time, Quantum Computation and Quantum Information remains the best textbook in this exciting field of science. This 10th anniversary edition includes an introduction from the authors setting the work in context. This comprehensive textbook describes such remarkable effects as fast quantum algorithms, quantum teleportation, quantum cryptography and quantum error-correction. Quantum mechanics and computer science are introduced before moving on to describe what a quantum computer is, how it can be used to solve problems faster than 'classical' computers and its real-world implementation. It concludes with an in-depth treatment of quantum information. Containing a wealth of figures and exercises, this well-known textbook is ideal for courses on the subject, and will interest beginning graduate students and researchers in physics, computer science, mathematics, and electrical engineering.},

@article{Hu:2023,
	abstract = {Thirty years after it was first proposed, quantum teleportation remains one of the most important protocols in quantum information and quantum technologies, enabling the nonlocal transmission of an unknown quantum state. Quantum teleportation can be used to overcome the distance limitation in directly transferring quantum states in quantum communication and the difficulty in realizing long-range interactions among qubits in quantum computation. Since 2015, experimental quantum teleportation has moved from simple to complex quantum states (multiple degrees of freedom, high-dimensional quantum states) and from proof-of-principle demonstrations to real-world applications. We overview these advances, in particular, the understanding of the nonclassical nature of quantum teleportation, the teleportation of complex quantum states, progress in experiments with photons, atoms and solid-state systems and applications to quantum communication and computation, and discuss the challenges and opportunities for future developments.},

@article{Takesue:2015,
	abstract = {Quantum teleportation is an essential quantum operation by which we can transfer an unknown quantum state to a remote location with the help of quantum entanglement and classical communication. Since the first experimental demonstrations using photonic qubits and continuous variables, the distance of photonic quantum teleportation over free-space channels has continued to increase and has reached {$>$}100\&{\#}x2009;\&{\#}x2009;km. On the other hand, quantum teleportation over optical fiber has been challenging, mainly because the multifold photon detection that inevitably accompanies quantum teleportation experiments has been very inefficient due to the relatively low detection efficiencies of typical telecom-band single-photon detectors. Here, we report on quantum teleportation over optical fiber using four high-detection-efficiency superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs). These SNSPDs make it possible to perform highly efficient multifold photon measurements, allowing us to confirm that the quantum states of input photons were successfully teleported over 100\&{\#}xA0;km of fiber with an average fidelity of 83.7\&{\#}xB1;2.0{\%}.},
