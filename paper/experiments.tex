\section{Experimental Evidence}
Experimental evidence for quantum teleportation in quantum communications.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Quantum teleportation has experimental evidence
    \item Experimental hurdles
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Satellite Based}
1400 km \cite{Ren:2017}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Protocol used
    \item distance
    \item technical difficulties and innovations
    \item what does this mean for quantum communications?
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Fibre Network Based}
100 km \cite{Takesue:2015}. Metropolitan \cite{Valivarthi:2016} 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Protocol used
    \item distance
    \item technical difficulties and innovations
    \item what does this mean for quantum communications?
\end{itemize}
