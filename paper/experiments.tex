The qubit system used in this experiment is based on the polarization of a photon with a state represented as $\ket{\chi}_1 = \alpha\ket{H}_1 + \beta\ket{V}_1$, with complex numbers
satisfying $\vert\alpha\vert² + \vert\beta\vert² = 1$ and $\ket{V}$ and $\ket{H}$ represents vertical and horizontal polarization respectively.
 At a ground station, two entangled photon pairs were prepared and one photon from each pair was
transmitted to a Satellite through a 130-mm diameter telescope with narrow beam divergence and high-precision tracking systmes to counteract the atmospheric turbulence.
The entangled pair of photons can be written as one of the Bell states,
\begin{equation}
    \ket{\psi^{+}}_{23} = (\ket{H}_2\ket{H}_3 + \ket{V}_2\ket{V}_3)/\sqrt{2},
\end{equation}
where photon 2 is the photon kept at the ground station and photon 3 was sent to the Satellite.

A joint measurement was one on the photon that was to be teleported and one of the entangled photons. This projects these photons into one of the Bell states.
The result from this measurment was then classically sent to the Satellite. This measurement forces the entangled pair into a new state. If this state is 
$\ket{\psi^{+}}_{12} = (\ket{H}_1\ket{H}_2 + \ket{V}_1\ket{V}_2)/\sqrt{2}$ the photon sent to the Satellite (photon 3) carries the state that photon 1 was in originally
and if the measured state is $\ket{\psi^{-}}_{12} = (\ket{H}_1\ket{H}_2 - \ket{V}_1\ket{V}_2)/\sqrt{2}$, the state of photon 3 is equivalent of the state of photon 1 shifted $\pi$.
