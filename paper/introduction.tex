\section{Introduction}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Quantum teleportation protocol
    \item Why is it needed?
    \item Areas of application, quantum communications, quantum computers
    \item what is needed to realize it on a large scale, i.e. quantum repeaters, memory...
    \item EPR-pairs and bell basis
