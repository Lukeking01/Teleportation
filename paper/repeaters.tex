\subsection{Entanglement swapping}

Assuming that Alice and Bob are too far apart from each other to efficiently transport an entangled state between them,
an option is entanglement swapping. Assume that Alice and Bob each share an entangled state with the third part, Charlie.
These states would be $\ket{\phi}_{AC_1}$ and $\ket{\phi}_{BC_2}$. If Charlie now performs a simultaneus measurement on his two states, $C_1$ and $C_2$
Alice and Bobs qubits will end up in an entangled state. This is a way of propagating entaglement through a third part to achieve more reliable longer distance entaglement.

\subsection{Quantum repeater protocol}
%No cloning but instead entanglement swapping
If long distance distribution of entanglement were to be achieved through optical fibers, one would experience an exponential loss of photons.
 To overcome this loss, quantum repeaters use heralded entanglement generation and entanglement swapping.
 Heralded entanglement generation involves establishing
 local Bell states between quantum memories and optical pulses at each party (e.g., Alice and a repeater node or two repeater nodes).
 The optical pulses are sent through fibers to a central station where a linear-optical Bell measurement is performed,
 projecting the pulses into an entangled Bell state with success probability 
 \begin{equation}
    p_g(l) = e^{-l/L_{\text{att}}}/2,
 \end{equation}
 where $l$ is the fiber length and $L_{\text{att}}$ is the attenuation length. \textbf{Något om hur $L_{att}$ är definierat}
 Once neighboring parties share entanglement with a repeater node, entanglement swapping extends the entanglement between more distant parties.
 This is achieved via a Bell measurement on the quantum memories at the repeater node, succeeding with probability $p_s = 1/2$ in the ideal case.
 Without repeaters, directly linking Alice and Bob requires an average number of trials 
 \begin{equation}
    \langle T^{(0)}_{\text{tot}} \rangle = p_g(L)^{-1} = 2e^{L/L_{\text{att}}},
 \end{equation}
 which grows exponentially with the distance $L$. With a single repeater node located midway, entanglement generation is performed in parallel for Alice-to-repeater and repeater-to-Bob links,
 each requiring 
 \begin{equation}
    \langle T_g(L/2) \rangle = 2e^{L/(2L_{\text{att}})}
 \end{equation}
 trials on average. Successful swapping at the repeater node then connects Alice and Bob,
 requiring 
 \begin{equation}
    \langle T^{(1)}_{\text{tot}} \rangle \sim p_s^{-1} p_g(L/2)^{-1} = 2^2 e^{L/(2L_{\text{att}})}
 \end{equation}
 trials, providing a square-root improvement compared to the direct link.
 This process generalizes with $N_{\text{QR}} = 2^n - 1$ equally spaced repeater nodes, where each step reduces the entanglement distance to $L/(N_{\text{QR}} + 1)$,
 achieving a total trial count of
 \begin{equation}
    \langle T^{(N_{\text{QR}})}_{\text{tot}} \rangle \sim 2^{1+\log_2(N_{\text{QR}} + 1)} e^{L/((N_{\text{QR}} + 1)L_{\text{att}})},
 \end{equation}
 exponentially improving efficiency. While this idealized protocol assumes perfect operations and quantum memories, practical implementations must account for memory errors,
 imperfect operations, and accumulated errors, mitigated by advanced error-suppression techniques. Thus,
 quantum repeaters enable scalable quantum communication by mitigating photon loss and other imperfections over long distances.
